no errors, this value can apparently be any string or “”

<changes to user>
OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (1045, "Access denied for user 'sdsf'@'localhost' (using password: YES)")

<removing or changing password>
OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (1045, "Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)")
fix: Make sure you pass the correct ‘password’ value to the mysql server

                ^

'database': friendsdb, # we got db as an argument
NameError: global name 'friendsdb' is not defined
fix: You must pass the name of the database currently running on the MySQL server as a string.  This can be hard coded into <mysqlconnection.py> or can be passed as a variable from <server.py>

<changes to the port>
OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (2003, "Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1' (61)")
fix: The value of this string must be the port that the MySQL server is currently using, which can be ascertained by checking the prefs of MAMP.
